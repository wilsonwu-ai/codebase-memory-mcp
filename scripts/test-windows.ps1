.SYNOPSIS
    Run the native-Windows red-test suite for codebase-memory-mcp.

.DESCRIPTION
    Builds the production binary (build/c/codebase-memory-mcp.exe) if it is not
    already present, then runs the deterministic Windows red tests under
    tests/windows/. These tests reproduce platform-specific failures at the
    product surface (real MCP process, real stdio, real SQLite DB).

    The unit/invariant C suite is built and run via Makefile.cbm. On native
    Windows the MinGW/LLVM toolchain ships no libasan/libubsan, so the sanitizer
    flags must be disabled for the local build (SANITIZE=). Where the toolchain
    *does* provide AddressSanitizer/UBSan (Linux containers, WSL), prefer
    scripts/test.sh which keeps the sanitizers on.

.PARAMETER Binary
    Path to an existing codebase-memory-mcp.exe. If omitted, the script looks for
    build/c/codebase-memory-mcp.exe and builds it when missing.

.PARAMETER Make
    Path to GNU make (default: 'make' on PATH; MSYS2 ships it at
    C:\msys64\usr\bin\make.exe).

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File scripts/test-windows.ps1
